[BACKGROUND]
Elevator
[JANITOR]
Default
[ENVIRONMENT]
After jamming out with the janitor for a long time the elevator finally gets fixed.

[PLAYER]
Sorry Mr. Janitor, but I gotta get to class.

[JANITOR]
Wink
Sure thing kid. Ya got goooooood rhythm.

[BACKGROUND]
Lecture Hall
[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
You arrive at class and students seem to be pouring out of the classroom. You walk in to see what is happening.

[PLAYER]
Sorry I’m a little bit late, what are we working on now?

[PROFESSOR]
Oh are you *PLAYER*?
Why weren’t you here today?

[PLAYER]
I am here though! I got stuck on the elevator for a bit, but-

[PROFESSOR]
What matters now is that the first day of class is done, and you have homework to do.

[PLAYER]
Class is done?!

[PROFESSOR]
Yes. why else would my class be leaving; The bell doesn’t dismiss you, I do.

[COSPLAYER]
Disinterest
C’mon, professor. We’re not in high school.

[PROFESSOR]
All the more reason to discipline you kids. 

[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
You quickly write down the homework from the first day:
Meet 5 people from your class and have them sign your notebook.

[PROFESSOR]
Most of the class got their homework done in class, remember to have it signed and ready for tomorrow.

[BACKGROUND]
Path 3
[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk outside the classroom into the hall,  and no-one is in sight, everyone has left.

[PLAYER]
Aw man, how am I gonna get these signatures? If everyone has already done the assignment, they won’t want to talk to me…


But now that I think about it, this could be a great way to meet people to recruit for a band!


Maybe some of the students from class are still around here somewhere. Surely not everyone has completely cleared out.

[BACKGROUND]
Fountain Plaza 2
[ENVIRONMENT]
As you leave the lecture hall and the building, loads of students are walking around the campus, and some are lounging on the grass and benches.

[PLAYER]
Alright. Who can I get to sign my paper? I don’t know if any of these people are in my class.

[BACKGROUND]
People Bench
[ENVIRONMENT]
You spot a woman on a bench using a laptop with headphones on. You recognize her as someone who spoke up to the professor after you got to class.

[PLAYER]
Hey, I know her. She told off the professor earlier. I should ask her to sign my paper… and I should probably say thanks.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk closer, your heartbeat speeding up.

[PLAYER]
Oh my gosh, this is the first person I’m going to meet in college. I’m so nervous.

Hey! How's it going?

[COSPLAYER]
Default
I’m doing pretty well. How ‘bout yourself?

[PLAYER]
My first day’s been pretty rough so far. Thanks for nosing off to the professor earlier, by the way.

[COSPLAYER]
Disinterest
Oh, my pleasure. That guy’s a jerk. I heard that last semester, he made everyone write an apology to him for not doing the homework, but it only happened because he forgot to post it.

[PLAYER]
Sounds like a nightmare.

[COSPLAYER]
Stare
A nightmare you are now living in. What’d you come in late for, anyway?

[PLAYER]
It’s kind of a long story. Would you mind signing my paper for the homework?

[COSPLAYER]
Smile
Sure, just as long as I can get yours. Here, sit down.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You sit down on the bench, getting a closer look at her outfit. It’s a… sailor uniform? with a red skirt and puffy sleeves.

[PLAYER]
Hey, your outfit is pretty cool.

[COSPLAYER]
Default
Thanks! It's what my favorite anime character wears.

[PLAYER]
Why do you dress like them?

[COSPLAYER]
Smirk
Because she’s a badass that always wears crazy outfits. Plus, it’s really fun to see people’s faces light up when they recognize the character. 

[PLAYER]
Do you cosplay every day? 

[COSPLAYER]
Shock
Oh yes. Cosplaying isn’t just for fun. It’s a lifestyle.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You both stare at each other wordlessly for a few seconds. You don’t really get it, but she seems to be taking it really seriously.

[COSPLAYER]
Stare
Anyway, let me help you with the homework.

[ENVIRONMENT]
Exchanging papers, you sign hers, and notice she already has four names written on hers. No one you know, of course. It might be a good idea to ask her where you can find other people to sign yours. While the cosplayer is signing your notebook, you see that she has some kind of music software open on her computer.

[PLAYER]
Do you make music?

[COSPLAYER]
Smile
I do, but it’s just kind of a hobby for now.

[PLAYER]
Mind if I take a listen?

[COSPLAYER]
Stare
Sure, just put these on for a second.
