[PLAYER]
Wow, this is amazing.

[RAVEN]

Thanks! 

I’ll admit I’ve been going back and forth on it for a while now, so that’s exciting to hear. 

I kinda needed fresh ears on it, so I’m glad this worked out.

[PLAYER]
Would you be up for joining my band?

[RAVEN]
Smile
Oh wow, really?

[PLAYER]
Yeah, I really like what I’m hearing!

I'm making a band for the battle of the bands competition coming up soon. 

I don’t really have enough members yet, and I think you’d be a great fit.


[RAVEN]
Laugh
I’d love to! 

I’ll work a couple things out in my schedule and I should be all set to join.


[PLAYER]
Awesome, It’s gonna be so great to have you. 

Annie’s actually in the band, too!


[RAVEN]
Smirk
Makes sense, she’s super excited about competitions.


[PLAYER]
Really? I didn’t think she was that competitive.


[RAVEN]
Default
Oh yeah, she enters in every single cosplay contest she can get to. 

I can’t promise I’ll be as excited as her, but I’m happy to be a part of this.


[ENVIRONMENT]
You both spend some more time working on your separate projects, and part ways a couple hours later.


[RAVEN]
Smile
It was so nice to meet you! 

Feel free to swing by the library whenever, I work there quite a bit.


[PLAYER]
Sure thing! Nice to meet you too!

[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
With your studying all taken care of for the day, you decide to spend more time walking around campus and seeing everything it has to offer.

[BACKGROUND]
Path 5
[ENVIRONMENT]
As you walk towards the student union, you see a couple people skateboarding near the side of the building. 

You don’t have a lot of experience with skating, but you see a bench nearby and decide to sit down. 

One of the people skating has a small speaker playing some music near the bench.

Before you can sit, you hear a little bit of commotion between one of the skaters and your grumpy professor.

[SKATER]
Frown
Hey, what are you doing?

[PROFESSOR]
Like I said, you kids can’t skate here! What if you hurt someone with one of those things?

[SKATER]
Smirk
Actually, there’s a sign right over there that says skating is permitted, plus we got permission from the head office!

[PROFESSOR]
I’m tired of you kids and your excuses! Not to mention this awful music! 

Stop this instant, or I’ll be forced to take down your names and give them to the dean!

[SKATER]
Shocked
But he’s the one we got permission from!

[PROFESSOR]
Ugh, I’ll see about that.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You see your professor storm away and decide to head over.

[PLAYER]
Hey, trouble with the Professor?

[SKATER]
Stare
Yeah dude, he’s so stubborn already and school’s barely even started yet. 

I mean I already have all my homework done, so what’s his damage?

[PLAYER]
I feel you, apparently he’s just like that.

[SKATER]
Frown
Ugh, I hope the dean can get through to him at least. 

I got permission to skate here with my buddies before school even started, it’d be a shame to have to stop just because one guy likes to start trouble.

[PLAYER]
I hope so too.

[SKATER]
Smile
You’re pretty chill, dude. You skate?

[PLAYER]
No, unfortunately. 

I think it’s cool but I don’t really have the time to learn now that school’s started.

[SKATER]
Default
Aw, that’s really too bad. 

I could always teach you or something if you wanted to learn.

[PLAYER]
Really? For free?

[SKATER]
Shocked
I mean yeah. 

I’m only a beginner myself, imagine how weird it would be if I charged you for some janky lessons.

[PLAYER]
I guess so, but don’t sell yourself short! 

You really held your own against that guy earlier. 

By the way, what’s your name?

[SKATER]
Laugh
All my friends here call me Luke.

[PLAYER]
Oh, nice!

By the way, if you do want to teach me to skate I have something I could offer in return.

[LUKE]
Stare
What’s up?

[PLAYER]
Do you play music?

[LUKE]
Default
Yeah, just a little bit though. 

I mostly play bass, but I also dabble in the trumpet every now and again.

[PLAYER]
Wanna be a part of my band?

[LUKE]
Shocked
Oh wow, that’s a big ask. 

Are you sure you want me for the job?

[PLAYER]
Well how about this, I’ll listen to you play, and then you can teach me how to skate.

[LUKE]
Smile
Sounds like a deal. 

Just so happens that my speaker is playing something I’ve been working on since summer started. 

It’s all finished now, so I have plenty of time to rehearse with you guys.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You start to pay more attention to the song playing from Luke's speaker and start feeling a strong urge to start skating...
