[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]
Thanks. yeah, I just make this stuff in my free time.

[PLAYER]
You know, I’m actually looking for someone to join me for the battle of the bands. you’re really talented, I would love to have you on the team. 

[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]
Sure, I’d love to. I’ve been waiting for the chance to show off my music.

[PLAYER]
Awesome! It’s great to have you on the team… you know, I never got your name.

[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]
Oh right. It’s hard to be in a band with someone if you don’t know their name. I’m Annie. Annie May. What about you?

[PLAYER]
I’m (player name). Thanks again for everything.

[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]   
My pleasure. Hey, you don’t know anyone else in our class, right?

[PLAYER]
Yeah, I wasn’t able to catch anyone's face before the professor chewed me out.

[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]
If you need more signatures, I know for sure that Chad goes to lift at the weight room after every class.

[PLAYER]
Gotcha. Thanks again for your help

[CHAR:]
[ANNIE]
Don’t thank me just yet. We still have to win.

[PLAYER]
Right.

[ENVIRONMENT] 
As you walk towards the Armsgard Center of Fitness, you see a tall muscular man, taller than anyone you’ve ever seen on campus, even taller than the JANITOR you met in the elevator. You feel motivated to go and ask him for some tips on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle whilst on campus. As you walk into the center, you hear what sounds like weights of unimaginable scale being lifted and then dropped violently like a crack of thunder. 

[CHAR:]
[ENVIRONMENT]
As you walk towards the the GCC weight room, you see a huge, gigantic man lifting weights all by himself.

[PLAYER]
OMG is he really one of the students that goes to Music 101? He looks tough...

[CHAR:]
[ENVIRONMENT]
You worryingly approach the absolute unit. As you get closer and closer you start to hear what sounds like a females voice singing. A language you dont understand. Eventually you realize it is coming from the man’s earbuds. It seems that as the beat picks up so does his pace.

[PLAYER]
Oh no.

[CHAR:]
[CHADWICK]
Oh, I didn’t scare you did I? Sorry if I did. I was too focused on this new hit song that a band I follow just released. 

[Player] 
Oh? What’s the band’s name? 

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
Have you ever heard of the KGB?

[Player]
Uuuuummm… no…?

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
Why of course! Korean Girl Band is only the greatest K-pop group of all time. Besides their amazing vocals, they did some of the best performances I’ve ever seen. They are probably the greatest thing on this earth.

[CHAR:]
[CHADWICK] 
Oh, right, you were here for the weights right? 

[Player]
Actually I was going to ask if you wanted to be a part of this band I’m making.

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick] 
Band? What for?

[Player] 
Oh there is this poster that talked about a battle of the bands, and it sounded like a pretty cool thing to do! 

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
Oh well then I might join it, but are you sure you want me? 

[Player] 
Yeah! If you want, we could see how well our rhythm matches-

[CHAR:]
[Oliver] 
Oi! Chadwick, I got your stupid bloody tickets for that dumb J-pop group you wanted! 

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
Oliver! Thank you very much, you’re the best! Oh and also it’s a k-pop band, not j-pop
*Chadwick moves over to Oliver and takes the tickets, and then proceeds to give him a bearhug*

[CHAR:]
[Oliver]
Ugh! Don’t touch me!! And besides they all are just pretending to be the real thing!  
*Oliver wiggles out of Chadwick’s bearhug, and does a pose that makes it obvious that he is referring to himself as being the ‘real thing’*

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
That's a very rude thing to say

[CHAR:]
[Oliver] 
So what? I’m just telling the truth, and besides that Ha-joon is just a fake and a fraud! 

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick] 
No one talks about my queen like that! Let’s duel! 

[CHAR:]
[Oliver] 
Heh, fine, I’ll show you that my ELITE moves are better than that fraud of an idol is! 
*Chadwick and Oliver then go to the middle of the room, and prepare to duke it out in a-*

[CHAR:]
[Chadwick]
Remember, no break dancing.

[CHAR:]
[Oliver]
All the better, but let’s move this to the plaza, I can’t show off my ELITE moves in this cramped space
