[PLAYER]
Wow, I never knew k-pop sounded so cool. You’re just what we need for the band.
[CHADWICK- SMILE]
Thanks, bro. You’ve got some good moves yourself. I’d definitely stan you.
[PLAYER]
Thanks. It’s getting late. I’ll see you at the competition.
[CHADWICK- DEFAULT]
I’ll be there. We’re gonna wipe the floor with the competition... figuratively, I mean.
[BACKGROUND]
Dorm Room 4
[ENVIRONMENT]
With the day reaching its end, you walk back to your dorm room.
[PLAYER]
Wow! my first day at GCC and I’ve already made some friends. I think this is going to be a good semester…


I FORGOT TO DO THE HOMEWORK!
(day ends)
Mother (Natalie)
[BACKGROUND]
store
[ENVIRONMENT]
The next day as you’re walking to class, you pass by the same GCC store you saw on your way to campus but spot a familiar face through the window.
[PLAYER]
Is that someone from my music class?
[ENVIRONMENT]
Knowing that you still need more members for the band, you muster your courage and walk towards her.
[PLAYER]
Oh hey…
[ENVIRONMENT]
As you call her name you suddenly remember that you don’t remember her name.
Not only that but as you start to call out to her, you see a tiny hand reach out from behind an aisle and grab the hem of her dress.
[CHILD]
Mama, that stranger over there is looking at you.
Mama, do you know that stranger?
[MOTHER- THOUGHT]
I don’t think they’re talking to us, sweetheart. We should leave them be.
[ENVIRONMENT]
Suddenly, as she starts to speak aloud you recall seeing her leave with her child the day you were late for class. You wish you’d caught her name earlier. You decide to approach her.
[PLAYER]
Hey! We’re in the same music class. I’m *player name*. 
[CHILD]
Why are you ugly? That’s an ugly name.
[MOTHER- DEFAULT]
Don’t be mean now, sweetheart! Hi, *player name*. It’s nice to talk to someone in one of my classes. It’s hard making friends in college. I’m Natalie, and this is my daughter, Ellie.
[PLAYER]
I can imagine. How long have you been going to school here?
[MOTHER- TALK]
Only a few days, actually. I went to college when I was younger, but I didn’t really enjoy how my career panned out after that. I figured there was no harm in going back, and enrolled in a few courses this year to see how I like it.
 [PLAYER]
Oh, that’s great. How are things going so far?
[MOTHER- HAPPY]
I’m only just starting out, so it feels like a whole new world for me. I think I’m getting the hang of things pretty quickly though. Being a mom means I’m used to being kept on my toes, so I’ve learned to adapt pretty quickly.
[CHILD]
Mom, let’s go. This person is smelly.
[MOTHER- MAD]
No they are not. You should apologize now, Ellie. That’s a very mean thing to say!
[CHILD]
I don’t wanna!
[PLAYER]
I get the feeling she doesn’t like me.
[MOTHER- THOUGHT]
Oh, she does the same thing to everybody. She just likes to mess with people.


And she’s gotten really good at it.
[PLAYER]
I bet I could get her to like me. How about I play some music?
[MOTHER- HAPPY]
I think that would be wonderful, actually. I was just about to go outside to do some studying, would you mind coming with me to watch her?
[PLAYER]
Uhm… I don’t know…
[MOTHER- DEFAULT] 
It would be a really big help to me, and I can pay you a bit if you’d like!
[PLAYER]
Sure! That sounds great!


[ENVIRONMENT]
After Natalie finishes buying what looks like snacks for her child, you walk with the two of them to the campus plaza, where Natalie quickly unpacks her schoolwork. She hands you her bag from the store.
[BACKGROUND]
Plaza Area
[MOTHER-DEFAULT]
Ellie loves her fruit snacks, so I’m sure she’ll want some now. I’ll also give you her tablet in case she wants to watch something on it. 


Thank you so much for agreeing to watch her for a bit, I just have to finish up one of my assignments and we’ll be on our way, I promise.
[PLAYER]
Do you think you could sign my notebook? I don’t have enough signatures for our class yet.
[MOTHER- HAPPY]
Of course.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You hand her your notebook, watching as her pen glides across the page. She hands the notebook back to you, starting to pay attention to her own assignment.
[MOTHER- SHOCK]
Are you sure you’ll be able to handle Ellie?
[PLAYER]
Don’t worry about it! I love babysitting!
[ENVIRONMENT]
You do not. Children can be very mean.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You sit down with Ellie, giving her a packet of fruit snacks.
[ELLIE]
Yay! How did you know I liked fruit snacks?
[PLAYER]
Umm… Only cool kids like fruit snacks!
[ELLIE]
Good! Because I am so cool! You might be cool too because you have fruit snacks. Not as cool as me though.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You didn’t think that would work as well as it did.
[PLAYER]
So do you like the music your mom makes?
[ELLIE]
I guess, but I like the music on the show I watch more!
[PLAYER]
And what show is that?
[ELLIE]
Bubblegumpie! It’s my favorite show of all time!
[ENVIRONMENT]
You vaguely recall the show. It’s new, and the music is simple and catchy.
[PLAYER]
That’s so cool! Do you want to play some music from Bubblegumpies?
[ENVIRONMENT]
Her eyes immediately light up and she claps happily. You’re not so bad at this babysitting thing after all.
[ELLIE]
Let’s play Bubblegumpies!
[ENVIRONMENT]
She takes the tablet from you and turns the show on. Every so often, she points at the screen and tells you to look when you’re already watching. It’s not a bad show, considering it’s for kids.
[ENVIRONMENT]
Before you know it, you’ve watched an entire episode of Bubblegumpies with Ellie.
[ELLIE]
Do you know how to play Bubblegumpies?
[PLAYER]
I do! Do you want to play it with me?
[ELLIE]
Yes!
[MUSIC SECTION]
Perfect: Yay!
Good: Awesome!
Okay: Aw…
Bad/Miss: Ew…
[ELLIE]
Wow! You’re so good at playing Bubblegumpies!
[PLAYER]
You are too! I think you’re really good at playing music. Maybe you can go to school for music like your mom!
[ELLIE]
I want to go to music school and be just like Momma now!
[ENVIRONMENT]
You notice that Natalie has finished her work, watching you and Ellie with a smile.
[MOTHER- DEFAULT]
Thank you so much, *player*, I really appreciate your help. Ellie, are you ready to go now? Momma has to take you home for lunch!
[ELLIE]
Do we have to? I like playing Bubblegumpies with *player*...
[MOTHER- HAPPY]
I promise we’ll play more Bubblegumpies when we get home, okay?
[ENVIRONMENT]
Ellie jumps up, skipping over to her mother and hugging her. Natalie looks back to you, taking her and Ellie’s things and standing up to leave.
[MOTHER- SHOCK]
Thanks again for watching my Ellie. Is there anything I can help you with?
[PLAYER]
Well, I need more members for a band I’m making, would you like to be in it? It’s for a competition.
[MOTHER-TALK]
I’d be happy to! And I’m sure Ellie wouldn’t mind having someone else to talk about her shows with.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You part ways with the two of them, and you check the time. Watching that show with Natalie’s kid took longer than expected, and now you have to go straight to class. It’s not the same class you have with Annie, but you don’t think being late to this one would be a good idea.


Overconfident (Oliver)
[BACKGROUND]
Lecture Hall
[ENVIRONMENT]
You rush to your class, looking around the lecture hall to see if you recognize anyone you’ve met so far. You don’t think you see anyone, until someone comes up to you.
[OLIVER- SMILE]
What’s up, cringelord?
[PLAYER]
Oh, hey. Oliver, right?
[OLIVER- SMUG]
Don’t you forget it! What are you doing here?
[PLAYER]
I’m here for my music course.
[OLIVER- FROWN]
Are you sure? This is a pretty high level course.
[PLAYER]
This is Music Concepts, right?
[OLIVER- SMILE]
Yeah!
[PLAYER]
Yeah, this is an intro course.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You both stare at each other in silence for a few seconds. Oliver seems annoyed.
[OLIVER- STARE]
Just as I expected. It’s obvious just by talking to you that you’re in the beginner course.
[PLAYER]
Aren’t you in this class?
[OLIVER- FROWN]
Yes, but I’m just taking it as a formality. It’s going to be an easy A for me.
[PLAYER]
So, how are you after yesterday? Did you end up going to the nurse’s office?
[OLIVER- SMUG]
No, I was perfectly fine. It takes more than a wardrobe malfunction to hurt me. Maybe Chadwick would’ve needed to go to the nurse’s office.
[PLAYER]
I’m pretty sure anyone would’ve needed to. It looked pretty painful.
[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver ignores your statement.
[OLIVER- DEFAULT]
Anyway, do you want to sit down with me? No doubt my expertise will help you in this class.
[PLAYER]
Sure. Hey, would you mind signing my notebook? It’s for another intro class.
[OLIVER- SMILE]
An autograph? Of course, let me get out my best pen!
[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver pulls a calligraphy pen from his bag. It has a large feather taped to it. He takes your notebook, but looks at the page and scoffs.
[OLIVER- MAD]
You’ve already had that imbecile Chadwick sign it? I guess you’re just letting anyone do it, then.
[PLAYER]
That was the assignment, yeah.
[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver quickly signs the notebook, giving it back to you without a second glance. His signature is taking up half the page, and a little bit of Chadwick’s name.
[OLIVER- SMILE]
So, if you’re smart enough to sit next to me, I have the best seat in the class.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You follow Oliver to his seat, a section in the middle. You notice that there’s no one sitting around him, and people seem to be sitting a cautious distance away.
[PLAYER]
Do you know anyone else here?
[OLIVER- SMUG]
No, I don’t really like to fraternize with the intro classes. Consider yourself incredibly lucky.
[PLAYER]
I’m considering myself something, alright.
[OLIVER- TALK]
Oh, shush. Class is about to start.
[ENVIRONMENT]
Your professor starts talking soon after that, and you assume class would’ve gone great if you weren’t sitting next to Oliver. Today’s lesson is on time signatures. It’s pretty easy, honestly.
[OLIVER- FROWN]
Ugh, this is so wrong. Everyone knows the best songs are in 11/4  time. Time means minutes, by the way, so good songs should be anywhere from 4 to 11 minutes.
[PLAYER]
Um, that’s not what that means at all.
[OLIVER- MAD]
It makes sense that as a beginner you wouldn’t know what you’re talking about at all. Just take notes based on what I tell you.
[ENVIRONMENT]
You decide not to question it, but you’re definitely not taking notes from Oliver. Ever.
[PROFESSOR]
Now, when you’re working with music in different time signatures, especially if you’re less familiar with music, it’s important to double check your work.
[OLIVER- FROWN]
That’s wrong too. Seriously, how do they hire these idiots? I always just do it on a computer.
[PLAYER]
But you still have to double check if what you’re doing sounds good if you’re working digitally…
[OLIVER- TALK]
No you don’t. The computer does it for you.
[PLAYER]
That’s… not how it works at all…
[ENVIRONMENT]
The rest of class drags on, with Oliver attempting to ‘teach’ you about different music concepts, and somehow getting even the basic concepts wrong. Maybe he needs this class more than you do.
[OLIVER- STARE]
I hope you’re planning on studying all that later. All the stuff I told you is really important to know.
[PLAYER]
I’ll try to get around to it. I’ve been pretty busy trying to get people to join my band–
[OLIVER- MAD]
You have a band? 
[PLAYER]
Yeah, it’s just made up of a couple of my friends I’ve made here so far, it’s for the battle of the bands competition.
[OLIVER- SMUG]
Aw, well I’m very flattered, but I’m much too busy to join your silly little band.
[PLAYER]
What?
[OLIVER- TONGUE OUT]
You obviously want me to join, bringing it up so suddenly. Alas, I must decline.
[PLAYER]
Oh, I guess I could find someone else then.
[OLIVER- FROWN]
No wait! You need my expertise, you had no idea what was going on in class. I’d be happy to lead your little band.
[PLAYER]
What? No, we just need more members, we’re not looking for a lead or anything, it’s mostly just for fun.
[OLIVER- TALK]
So you don’t have a lead? Perfect.
[PLAYER]
Well, no, that’s not what I meant.
[OLIVER- DEFAULT]
Oh, fine, I’ll join if you beg.
[PLAYER]
I’m not going to beg.
[OLIVER- FROWN]
Okay, I’ll join anyway.
[PLAYER]
Okay… Well can I see how you perform? Just so we know what direction we want to go with the band?
[OLIVER- SMILE]
I’d be happy to show off my skills.
[RHYTHM]
