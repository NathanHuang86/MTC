That was awesome!

[SKATER]
Pretty sick right? Yeah, I stayed up all night for a while working on it. I think it’s some of my best work so far.

[PLAYER]
It definitely shows. You said you’re available to rehearse right?

[SKATER]
Yeah, now that my schedule’s all figured out with school, I have tons of time to work on something new.

[PLAYER]
That’s great! You’re gonna do great.

[SKATER]
Thanks dude, that means a lot to me. So, you still wanna learn to shred it?

[ENVIRONMENT]
You spend around an hour learning with [SKATER], and by the end you can’t really do much but ride on the board.
Your balance could definitely get better, but considering you started not knowing how to do anything on a board, you’re pretty proud of yourself! Skater also seems to be pretty proud of you, and lets you get the hang of it without hassling you

[SKATER]
Hey dude, you did great out there today! You must be a fast learner, huh?

[PLAYER]
I guess so! It’ll be so nice having you in the band.

[SKATER]
Likewise! You’re a pretty cool person to chill with. Feel free to let me know if you want more lessons, I’ll have to take you down to the real skate park sometime.

[PLAYER]
Thank you, will do!

[ENVIRONMENT]
With all of the requirements met for getting a band together, you start making plans to rehearse for the Battle of the Bands. You can’t believe you already have everything ready to start practicing! You sleep easy that night, ready for the day
