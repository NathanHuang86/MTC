Path 5
[PLAYER]
That was awesome!

[SKATER]
Smile
Pretty sick right? 

Yeah, I stayed up all night for a while working on it. 

I think it’s some of my best work so far.

[PLAYER]
It definitely shows. You said you’re available to rehearse right?

[SKATER]
Default
Yeah, now that my schedule’s all figured out with school, I have tons of time to work on something new.

[PLAYER]
That’s great! You’re gonna do great.

[SKATER]
Wink
Thanks dude, that means a lot to me. 

So, you still wanna learn to shred it?

[ENVIRONMENT]
You spend around an hour learning with Luke, and by the end you can’t really do much but balence on the board.

Your balance could definitely get better, but considering you started not knowing how to do anything on a board, you’re pretty proud of yourself! 

Luke also seems to be pretty proud of you, and lets you get the hang of it without hassling you.

[SKATER]
Shocked
Hey dude, you did great out there today! 

You must be a fast learner, huh?

[PLAYER]
I guess so! 

It’ll be so nice having you in the band.

[SKATER]
Default
Likewise! 

You’re a pretty cool person to chill with.

Feel free to let me know if you want more lessons, I’ll have to take you down to the real skate park sometime.

[PLAYER]
Thank you, will do!

[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
With all of the requirements met for getting a band together, you start making plans to rehearse for the Battle of the Bands. 

You can’t believe you already have everything ready to start practicing!

[BACKGROUND]
Dorm Room 4
[ENVIRONMENT]
After heading back to your dorm, you start sending out texts and emails to all your bandmates to set up your first rehearsal 

After you contact everyone you set down your phone and close your eyes.

[PLAYER]
To think that only a few days ago I didn't know anyone in this school.

I would have never belived that I'd already have a band to play with, or that I'd be entering a battle of the bands concert.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You sleep easy that night, getting rested for the days of practice ahead.

[BACKGROUND]
Hallway 2
[ENVIRONMENT]
For the next two weeks you got together with your band to rehearse your performance.

At first, it was difficult for everyone's different musical styles to mesh together.

However, once everyone started to get to know each other the band's sound became more and more refined.

Before you knew it, it was the day of the battle and you felt more confident than ever.

Alright, is everyone here?

[CHADWICK]
Smile
Yup!

[OLIVER]
Smug
Of course! What would you do without me?

[COSPLAYER]

Right here!

[ELLIE]

Mom do I have to watch your concert?

[MOTHER]
Happy
Yes Ellie, and if you're good tonight I'll let you watch more Bubblegumpies when we get home!

[ELLIE]
Happy
Yayyy!!!

[SKATER]

Yo!

[PREP]
Wink
I made it!

[RAVEN]

Don't forget me!

[PLAYER]
[LEAVE]
Ok perfect, we're all here.

Let's go get checked in and then we can warm up before the battle.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk over to the check in area with the band.

There is a woman there with a clipboard writing down the names of the competing bands

[PLAYER]
Excuse me, we'd like to enter the competition.

[ENVIRONMENT]
The woman looks at you and your band, then back at her clipboard, then back at your band.

[STAFF]
I'm sorry, it looks like you don't have enough members to compete.

The requirement for this event is nine members per band, and I only see eight here.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You do a quick head count and sure enough, you only have eight members including yourself.

Your heart drops to the floor.

All the time you had spent practicing would be for nothing, all because you forgot to double check the requirements.

[PLAYER]
I-

I'm so sorry everyone, this is all my fault.

[CHADWICK]
Shock
It's ok bro, we all make mistakes

[PREP]
Bored
Yeah don't worry about it, we can always enter the next one.

[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
Despite their reassurance, you can't help but feel like a failure.

As you begin to gather your gear you notice a familiar face mopping the floor in the corner.

[JANITOR]
Smile
Doo doo doo, moppin the floor.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You remember the janitor from your first day of school, and how you two jammed out for a while in the elevator.

You realize there might be a way your band can perform after all. 

[PLAYER]
Hey, Mr. Janitor, I need your help.

[JANITOR]
Shock
What can I do for ya buddy?

[ENVIRONMENT]
You explain to the janitor your situation while he continues to mop the floor.

[JANITOR]
Nod
So you need me to play in the band with you?

[PLAYER]
I know that's a lot to ask, but you'd be doing us a big favor.

[JANITOR]
Wink
Sure thing kid.

[Janitor]
Shock
But what instrument should I play?

[PLAYER]
Hmmm...

Could you keep rhythm with your mop?

[JANITOR]
Smile
I suppose I could.

[PLAYER]
Perfect!

We're back in the battle of the bands!

[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
You walk back up to the check in area and get your band entered into the concert.

After rehearsing for a while it's time to perform.

Everyone takes their place on stage, waiting for your signal.

[PLAYER]
Alright, here we go.
