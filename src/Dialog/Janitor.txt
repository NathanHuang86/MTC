[BACKGROUND]
Outside
[ENVIRONMENT]
You walk up to the campus you have seen online and in brochures a thousand times.

In front of you stands a large courtyard with the GCC logo standing proud above it welcoming you to campus

[PLAYER]
Wow, I can’t believe I’m finally here! College is so busy and cool!

[ENVIRONMENT]
As you walk into the music building for the first time you are overwhelmed by the number of students you see.

[PLAYER]
Whew, I finally made it to the music wing here at GCC.
I have a lot of tough classes ahead of me, but I should also remember to have fun.
Maybe I should look for some clubs to join.

[BACKGROUND]
Poster
[ENVIRONMENT]
Through all the bustling students going to and from class you see a poster on a cork board that catches your eye. One advertising a battle of the bands. 

The winning band gets a…

1,200 dollar cash prize?! That’s amazing!

Seems like a great opportunity, but it looks like you need at least 8 members to enter. Weird, that seems like a lot for a band.

[PLAYER]
Well that’s just too bad.

I just moved here and don’t know anyone yet.

Might be a fun thing to do another year, but for now I should just stick to getting to class on ti--.

Wait! Class!

Oh no! I was so caught up in exploring that I forgot about my classes! My first one starts in five minutes!

[BACKGROUND]
Stairs
[PLAYER]
Shoot, the stairs are wet!

I guess I’ll just have to use the elevator

[BACKGROUND]
Elevator Door
[ENVIRONMENT]
You go over to the elevator and press the button, looking at the time again. As you slide into the elevator and press for floor two you see a custodian coming from the basement with a mop.

[BACKGROUND]
Elevator
[ENVIRONMENT]
You hold the door open for the custodian, who shuffles in quickly with his equipment.

[PLAYER]
Sorry, I was going to use the stairs, but they’re wet.

[JANITOR]
Default
It’s no problem, thanks for holding the doors open! Usually we clean the stairs after everyone’s gone home, but we got a new schedule and now we have to clean them every day around noon.

[PLAYER]
So you're a janitor here at GCC, that has to be fun!

[JANITOR]
Default
Yeah it's not too bad. I should introduce myself, my name is To--

[PLAYER]
I’m sorry, but I don’t really have time to chat, I’m running late for a class right now.

[ENVIRONMENT]
After awkwardly cutting off the janitor, the elevator shuts down and you find yourselves stuck together.

To ease the tension, the janitor starts humming to the elevator music and banging his mop handle against the door to the beat.
The groove is infectious and you can't help but join in
