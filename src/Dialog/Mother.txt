Wow, I never knew k-pop sounded so cool. You’re just what we need for the band.

[CHADWICK]
Smile
Thanks, bro. You’ve got some good moves yourself. I’d definitely stan you.

[PLAYER]
Thanks. It’s getting late. I’ll see you at the competition.

[CHADWICK]
Default
I’ll be there. We’re gonna wipe the floor with the competition... figuratively, I mean.

[BACKGROUND]
Dorm Room 4
[ENVIRONMENT]
[LEAVE]
With the day reaching its end, you walk back to your dorm room.

[PLAYER]
Wow! my first day at GCC and I’ve already made some friends. I think this is going to be a good semester…

(day ends)

[BACKGROUND]
Lounge 2
[ENVIRONMENT]
The next day as you’re walking to class, you pass by the same GCC store you saw on your way to campus but spot a familiar face through the window.

[PLAYER]
Is that someone from my music class?

[ENVIRONMENT]
Knowing that you still need more members for the band, you muster your courage and walk towards her.

[PLAYER]
Oh hey…

[ENVIRONMENT]
As you call her name you suddenly remember that you don’t remember her name.
Not only that but as you start to call out to her, you see a tiny hand reach out from behind an aisle and grab the hem of her dress.

[CHILD]
Default
Mama, that stranger over there is looking at you.
Mama, do you know that stranger?

[MOTHER]
Thought
I don’t think they’re talking to us, sweetheart. We should leave them be.

[ENVIRONMENT]
Suddenly, as she starts to speak aloud you recall seeing her leave with her child the day you were late for class. You wish you’d caught her name earlier. You decide to approach her.

[PLAYER]
Hey! We’re in the same music class. I’m *player name*. 

[CHILD]
Default
Why are you ugly? That’s an ugly name.

[MOTHER]
Default
Don’t be mean now, sweetheart! Hi, *player name*. It’s nice to talk to someone in one of my classes. It’s hard making friends in college. I’m Natalie, and this is my daughter, Ellie.

[PLAYER]
I can imagine. How long have you been going to school here?

[MOTHER]
Talk
Only a few days, actually. I went to college when I was younger, but I didn’t really enjoy how my career panned out after that. I figured there was no harm in going back, and enrolled in a few courses this year to see how I like it.

[PLAYER]
Oh, that’s great. How are things going so far?

[MOTHER]
Happy
I’m only just starting out, so it feels like a whole new world for me. I think I’m getting the hang of things pretty quickly though. Being a mom means I’m used to being kept on my toes, so I’ve learned to adapt pretty quickly.

[CHILD]
Happy
Mom, let’s go. This person is smelly.

[MOTHER]
Mad
No they are not. You should apologize now, Ellie. That’s a very mean thing to say!

[CHILD]
Mad
I don’t wanna!

[PLAYER]
I get the feeling she doesn’t like me.

[MOTHER]
Thought
Oh, she does the same thing to everybody. She just likes to mess with people.

And she’s gotten really good at it.

[PLAYER]
I bet I could get her to like me. How about I play some music?

[MOTHER]
Happy
I think that would be wonderful, actually. I was just about to go outside to do some studying, would you mind coming with me to watch her?

[PLAYER]
Uhm… I don’t know…

[MOTHER]
Default
It would be a really big help to me, and I can pay you a bit if you’d like!

[PLAYER]
Sure! That sounds great!

[ENVIRONMENT]
After Natalie finishes buying what looks like snacks for her child, you walk with the two of them to the campus plaza, where Natalie quickly unpacks her schoolwork. She hands you her bag from the store.

[BACKGROUND]
Plaza Area
[MOTHER]
Default
Ellie loves her fruit snacks, so I’m sure she’ll want some now. I’ll also give you her tablet in case she wants to watch something on it. 


Thank you so much for agreeing to watch her for a bit, I just have to finish up one of my assignments and we’ll be on our way, I promise.

[PLAYER]
Do you think you could sign my notebook? I don’t have enough signatures for our class yet.

[MOTHER]
Happy
Of course.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You hand her your notebook, watching as her pen glides across the page. She hands the notebook back to you, starting to pay attention to her own assignment.

[MOTHER]
Shock
Are you sure you’ll be able to handle Ellie?

[PLAYER]
Don’t worry about it! I love babysitting!

[ENVIRONMENT]
You do not. Children can be very mean.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You sit down with Ellie, giving her a packet of fruit snacks.

[ELLIE]
Default
Yay! How did you know I liked fruit snacks?

[PLAYER]
Umm… Only cool kids like fruit snacks!

[ELLIE]
Default
Good! Because I am so cool! You might be cool too because you have fruit snacks. Not as cool as me though.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You didn’t think that would work as well as it did.

[PLAYER]
So do you like the music your mom makes?

[ELLIE]
Default
I guess, but I like the music on the show I watch more!

[PLAYER]
And what show is that?

[ELLIE]
Default
Bubblegumpie! It’s my favorite show of all time!

[ENVIRONMENT]
You vaguely recall the show. It’s new, and the music is simple and catchy.

[PLAYER]
That’s so cool! Do you want to play some music from Bubblegumpies?

[ENVIRONMENT]
Her eyes immediately light up and she claps happily. You’re not so bad at this babysitting thing after all.

[ELLIE]
Default
Let’s play Bubblegumpies!

[ENVIRONMENT]
She takes the tablet from you and turns the show on. Every so often, she points at the screen and tells you to look when you’re already watching. It’s not a bad show, considering it’s for kids.

[ENVIRONMENT]
Before you know it, you’ve watched an entire episode of Bubblegumpies with Ellie.

[ELLIE]
Default
Do you know how to play Bubblegumpies?

[PLAYER]
I do! Do you want to play it with me?

[ELLIE]
Default
Yes!
