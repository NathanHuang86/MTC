[Chadwick]
Alright, it’s time I show you my moves! I learned this move from watching the latest MV from KGB!

[ENVIRONMENT]
The character Chadwick Chaddermen proceeds to masterfully twist and turn into a pose, that in a way would make one fall into a trance, as he continues to dance, the crowd watches in awe*  

[Oliver] 
Heh, that's it? Psh, I could do that in my sleep, time to show you my ELITE MOVES!

[ENVIRONMENT]
As Oliver boldly states that, the crowd of jocks gasps, as how could some random person confidently state they could outdance KGB!

[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver then proceeds to break it down in a way unlike you have ever seen, Oliver’s ELITE execution stunned the crowd, and for a moment it seems like he’d win this match in a heart bea-

[ENVIRONMENT]
OH SHI- 

[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver slips and falls on his side, a hush falling over the forming crowd as he groans and rolls on the floor. When he realizes people are watching him, he quickly jumps to his feet, brushing himself off and cockily smiling at Chadwick. He puffs his chest out and puts his hands on his hips triumphantly.

[Chadwick] 
Oliver! You alright bro?

[ENVIRONMENT]
Chadwick Chaddermen rushes to Oliver’s side to see if his homie is alright

[Oliver]
Yeah I’m fine, It was my damn shoe’s fault! That’s it, if it weren’t for my shoe failing me, I would’ve won.

[Chadwick]
It’s alright bro, you just need to work on your coordination, and then maybe your shoe wouldn’t have failed you. Now let’s get you to the health office and get you checked out.

[ENVIRONMENT]
It’s clear that Oliver isn’t in great shape. He’s leaning over to one side, rubbing his thigh and wincing.

[Oliver]
Pah! I’m fine, I don't need anyone to walk me there, I can walk there by myself! HMPH!

[ENVIRONMENT]
Oliver then proceeds to limp away from the plaza, his head still held high.

[Player]
I hope he’s ok.

[Chadwick] 
Yeah, he’s stubborn and very proud, but he’s still a good friend of mine. I hope he comes around and starts stanning KGB, but he doesn’t really like my bias, Ha-joon.

[Player]
Well that’s tough…

[Chadwick]
So uh, what’d you think of my moves?

[Player]
Oh they were pretty neat, especially with how you moved to the rhythm, it was awesome!

[Chadwick]
Gee, thanks! So about that band gig you were trying to tell me about, do you think I’m good enough to be in it?

[Player] 
OH! Right, the competition is coming up and I was wondering if you'd like to join. After seeing you move that way, I think you’d be a great fit.

[Chadwick]
Say no more! How do I join?

[Player] 
Would you be willing to duel me? So we could see how well we work as a band? 

[Chadwick] 
Sure! Wanna go right now? 

[ENVIRONMENT]
Chadwick raises his fists, adopting a fighting stance.

[Player] 
Yeah!

[PLAYER]
Wow, I never knew k-pop sounded so cool. You’re just what we need for the band.

[CHADWICK]
Thanks, bro. You’ve got some good moves yourself. I’d definitely stan you.

[PLAYER]
Thanks. It’s getting late. I’ll see you at the competition.

[CHADWICK]
I’ll be there. We’re gonna wipe the floor... figuratively, I mean.

[ENVIRONMENT]
With the day reaching its end, you walk back to your dorm room.

[PLAYER]
Wow! my first day at GCC and I’ve already made some friends. I think this is going to be a good semester…

I FORGOT TO DO THE HOMEWORK!

[ENVIRONMENT]
The next day as you’re walking to class, you pass by the same GCC store you saw on your way to campus but spot a familiar face through the window.

[PLAYER]
Is that someone from my music class?

[ENVIRONMENT]
Knowing that you still need more members for the band, you muster your courage and walk towards her.

[PLAYER]
Oh hey yo-

[ENVIRONMENT]
As you call her name you suddenly remember that you don’t remember her name.
Not only that but as you start to call out to her, you see a tiny hand reach out from behind an aisle and grab the hem of her dress.

[CHILD]
MOM MOM, that stranger over there is calling to you.
MOM MOM MOM, do you know that strange person?

[WOMAN]
I don’t think they’re talking to us, sweetheart. We should leave them be.

[ENVIRONMENT]
Suddenly, as she starts to speak aloud you recall seeing her leave with her child the day you were late for class. You wish you’d caught her name earlier. You decide to approach her.

[PLAYER]
Hey! We’re in the same music class. I’m *player name*. 

[CHILD]
Why are you ugly? That’s an ugly name.

[MOTHER]
Don’t be mean now, sweetheart! Hi, *player name*. It’s nice to talk to someone in one of my classes. It’s hard making friends in college at my age. I’m Natalie, and this is my daughter, Ellie.

[PLAYER]
I can imagine. How long have you been going to school here?

[MOTHER]
Only a few days, actually. I went to college when I was younger, but I didn’t really enjoy how my career panned out after that. I figured there was no harm in going back, and enrolled in a few courses this year to see how I like it.

 [PLAYER]
Oh, that’s great. How are things going so far?

[MOTHER]
I’m only just starting out, so it feels like a whole new world for me. I think I’m getting the hang of things pretty quickly though. Being a mom means I’m used to being kept on my toes, so I’ve learned to adapt pretty quickly.

[CHILD]
Mom, let’s go. This person is smelly.

[MOTHER]
No they are not. You should apologize now, Ellie. That’s a very mean thing to say!

[CHILD]
I don’t wanna!

[PLAYER]
I get the feeling she doesn’t like me.

[MOTHER]
Oh, she does the same thing to everybody. She just likes to mess with people.

And she’s gotten really good at it.

[PLAYER]
I bet I could get her to like me. How about I play some music?

[MOTHER]
I think that would be wonderful, actually. I was just about to go outside to do some studying, would you mind coming with me to watch her?

[PLAYER]
Uhm… I don’t know…

[MOTHER] 
It would be a really big help to me, and I can pay you a bit if you’d like!

[PLAYER]
Sure! That sounds great!

[ENVIRONMENT]
After Natalie finishes buying what looks like snacks for her child, you walk with the two of them to the campus plaza, where Natalie quickly unpacks her schoolwork. She hands you her bag from the store.

[ENVIRONMENT]
The campus plaza, quiet and still. There are sets of tables and chairs close to the camera.

[MOTHER]
Ellie loves her fruit snacks, so I’m sure she’ll want some now. I’ll also give you her tablet in case she wants to watch something on it. Thank you so much for agreeing to watch her for a bit, I just have to finish up one of my assignments and we’ll be on our way, I promise.

[PLAYER]
Do you think you could sign my notebook? I don’t have enough signatures for one of my classes yet.

[MOTHER]
Of course.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You hand her your notebook, watching as her pen glides across the page. She hands the notebook back to you, starting to pay attention to her own assignment.

[MOTHER]
Are you sure you’ll be able to handle Ellie?

[PLAYER]
Don’t worry about it! I love babysitting!

[ENVIRONMENT]
You do not. Children can be very mean.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You sit down with Ellie, giving her a packet of fruit snacks.

[ELLIE]
Yay! How did you know I liked fruit snacks?

[PLAYER]
Umm… Only cool kids like fruit snacks!

[ELLIE]
Good! Because I am so cool! You might be cool too because you have fruit snacks. Not as cool as me though.

[ENVIRONMENT]
You didn’t think that would work as well as it did.

[PLAYER]
So do you like the music your mom makes?

[ELLIE]
I guess, but I like the music on the show I watch more!

[PLAYER]
And what show is that?

[ELLIE]
Bubblegumpie! It’s my favorite show of all time!

[ENVIRONMENT]
You vaguely recall the show. It’s new, and the music is simple and catchy.

[PLAYER]
That’s so cool! Do you want to play some music from Bubblegumpies?

[ENVIRONMENT]
Her eyes immediately light up and she claps happily. You’re not so bad at this babysitting thing after all.

[ELLIE]
Let’s play Bubblegumpies!

[ENVIRONMENT]
She takes the tablet from you and turns the show on. Every so often, she points at the screen and tells you to look when you’re already watching. It’s not a bad show, considering it’s for kids.

[ENVIRONMENT]
Before you know it, you’ve watched an entire episode of Bubblegumpies with Ellie.

[ELLIE]
Do you know how to play Bubblegumpies?

[PLAYER]
I do! Do you want to play it with me?

[ELLIE]
Yes!
